# This is a Trello-like app where frontend is built on React-Redux and backend is built on NodeJS with TypeScript

## Run the app

The repository includes frontend as well as the backend. 
Ensure that you have NodeJS installed.
Clone the repository and follow the below instructions:

### Start the backend

Move to the back-end folder, install the NPM dependencies and start the app.
```
cd back-end
npm install
npm run start
```
The port for backend is configured as 3001, feel free to change it from config.ts if required.

### Start the frontend

Move to the front-end folder, install the NPM dependencies and start the app.
```
cd front-end
npm install
npm start
```
Browse to http://localhost:3000 to load the frontend. Use Google Chrome V80 or greater for the best experience.
